# Show Player Stats
This is a very simple plugin that prints the stats of all players on the server to the console in JSON format. Also prints the name of the next map, current map, timeleft, as well as minor server settings such as random crits, as well as whether or not [anon mode](https://github.com/EtraIV/TF2-Imageboard-GreenText) is enabled.

# Usage
